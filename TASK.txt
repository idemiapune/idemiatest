(1.) Create RestFul endpoint/s for managing (CRUD) a resource as below in
MySQL database named 'idemiatest':

      SaleItem
         - itemName
         - price (in INR)
         - percentDiscount
         
(2.) Create another RestFul endpoint with the purpose of creating a view
which will use above resource named SaleItem in the database to
present below
      
      Input: http://localhost:8080/saleitem/details/{id}
      
      Output:
      
      {
         "itemName":"",
         "price-in-INR":"",
         "discountAmount-in-INR":"",
         "payableAmountAfterDiscount-in-INR":"",
         "payableAmountAfterDiscount-in-USD":""
      }
      
 Note: On the server side fetch the INR -> USD conversion rate dynamically 
 from a RestFul endpoint http://10.72.6.70:8080/getusdconvrate (httpMethod: GET)
 Use some RestFul library to develop a client OR use plain httpClient/URL Connection
 to fetch this data. Feel free to google out.
